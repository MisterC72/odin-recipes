    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Baguette pizza is a quick and easy way to make homemade pizza. It's a great way to use up leftover baguettes and you can top it with whatever you like.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 French baguette</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>2/3 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>2 ounces cooked and crumbled sausage</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sliced pepperoni</li>        
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Split baguette in half lengthwise. Warm pizza sauce in a microwave-safe bowl until hot, about  45 seconds.</li>
        <li>Spread pizza sauce on baguette, sprinkle on cheese, and scatter sausage and pepperoni on top as desired. Place pizza onto a baking tray.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is golden, about 18 minutes. Optional step: turn on the ovenâ€™s broiler, set a rack 6 inches below the heating element, and broil the pizza for a deeper color, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
